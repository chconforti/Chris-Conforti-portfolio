	  <h1>Introduction</h1>
	  <p>I'm a simple guy living in New Jersey. I just married my amazing wife Carolyn in October and am looking forward to a lifetime of happiness with her.</p>
	  <p>The most important things to me are the health and safety of my family. I'm looking to start a new chapter in my life and enjoy a new level of success that I have not attained yet.</p>
	  <p>Currently, I am employed by Noble Insights. I work to find our client industry leading professionals for quick consulting calls. While it is an interesting industry I can't see myself doing it for life. Coding however is something I can see myself growing
	    in and being excited at the prospect of learning new things all the time.</p>

	  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
	  <p>I was born in Crossville, TN and moved to New Jersey shortly before starting first grade. I now make my home in Butler, NJ.</p>
	  <p>Butler is a pretty fun place. We are a short drive to New York City and are close to our friends and family which will make it easier once our own family starts to grow.</p>
